<h1>Bradley Taunt</h1>

I'm Bradley Taunt, a designer/developer hybrid working in the Great White North. Currently, I work at Benbria as a senior product designer in Ottawa. My passion lies in building modular CSS, with a focus on accessibility and web performance.

In my spare time I also run: <a href="http://www.vanillacss.com/">Vanilla CSS</a> (WIP) and <a href="http://remotejobs.design/">Remote Jobs for Designers</a>
