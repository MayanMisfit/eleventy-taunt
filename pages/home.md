# I'm Bradley Taunt, a designer passionate about building intuitive UI.

Currently, I am senior product designer at <a href="http://benbria.com">Benbria</a>. I focus on creating beautiful user experiences with scalable CSS, unobtrusive code, accessibility, and web performance in mind.

I live in beautiful Mountain, Ontario with my wife, our son, two cats, and the family pooch. If you'd like to know what I'm currently up to - check out my <a href="/now">now page</a>.
