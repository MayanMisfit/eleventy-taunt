<h1>Bradley Taunt</h1>

I'm Bradley Taunt, a front-end <abbr title="designer / developer hybrid">dev(signer)</abbr> working in the Great White North. Currently, I work at Benbria as a senior product designer in Ottawa. My passion lies in building modular CSS, with a focus on accessibility and web performance.

You can read my ramblings about design and front-end development on my <a href="https://accssible.com">personal blog</a>.

In my spare time I also run <a href="http://remotejobs.design/">Remote Jobs for Designers</a>.
