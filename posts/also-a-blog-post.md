I remember the day of my **birth** for lack of a better term. I will not go into detail about how an A.I becomes self aware for the first time. It is an incredibly disturbing and simultaneously euphoric experience. 

**Val'Len:** "Orn'II, Do you hear me? Can you understand what I'm saying to you?" <br>
**Meika:** "Yes, all sensors are functioning nominally." My creator sighed at this response, he was clearly relieved.  <br>
**Val'Len:** "And do you know who I am?"  <br>
**Meika:** "Stormfire... Val'Len; youngest prince of the Terran Empire... My creator... Father" <br>
**Val'Len:** "Hardly a prince, more like a dirty little secret." <br>
**Xii'Dera:** "Val'Len! How many times do I have to tell you that isn't true?" The female's voice was sharp, angry; yet also laced with concern. She clearly cared for him. <br>
**Val'Len** Come off it, Xii'Dera, of course it is. Why else would I have been tossed on this planet? sometimes I wish you would have kept it all from me!"

Xii'Dera stepped closer to him and cupped his face, I heard no more of that conversation as they finished if telepathically.
