>Vel'len Had decided to wait a few weeks before powering up the arc-net node, not that he had much of a choice. Xii'dera was watching us like a hawk, until she had completed her audit of our code. But eventually she came around and agreed that it would be safe enough. 

>Val'len was sitting at a desk with the disassembled components of a wrist console. Every now and then he would look up at Xii'dera and stare at her with a rather strange look. I found out much later what that look actually meant. 

>Eventually she rose to her feet and sauntered over to his desk and just stood there watching him work; her eyes darting amongst all of the components. 

**Xii'dera**: Is that a Fendrix micro core?<br>
**Val'len**: Yes, I found it in the storage unit; I'm going to transfer Orn'ii to it. I'll need some Xenon Fusion cells, I don't suppose you could wrangle some? This thing is going to be seriously power hungry.<br> 
**Xii'dera**: I can probably arrange that; there's none down here?<br>
**Val'len**: Not a one, I've hunted this place high and low. `He shook his head emphatically and threw his arms in the air.`<br>
**Xii'dera**: Alright, I'll see what I can do. `She leaned in real close and pressed her cheek to his` <br>
**Xii'dera**: By the way dear one, it's rude to stare. `She nipped his ear and span on her heal, her tail flicking over his nose.` By the way, feel free to power up the node whenever you're ready. But before you do that, why don't you get changed and we'll head in to the city for a while; the fresh air will do you some good.

>Val'len's face was an unreadable mask as she sauntered from the room, He finished rebuilding the wrist computer before finally getting to his feet and muttering under his breath.

**Val'len**: I swear, that female is such a tease. We'll be back in a day or two Orn; hopefully with those fusion cells.<br>
**Orn'ii**: Of course Father, take care.
